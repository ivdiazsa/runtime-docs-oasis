Ideas to Implement in the Documentation's Rescue:

- Unify or link the main README with the docs' README.

- Unify the building docs of CLR, Libraries, and Mono. This is because the three
  have a decently sized chunk of instructions that are pretty much the same.

- Unify all Markdown's formatting.
